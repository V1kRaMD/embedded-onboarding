the flag is:
flag{arm_nm_gdb_master}

what I ran:
nm vault.elf | grep "flag"
gdb vault.elf
print secret_flag

what each of these commands do:
when I ran "nm vault.elf" it gave me a huge list of symbols and stuff, so I pipelined it using grep to find something with flag
it gave me two results and one literally said "secret_flag" so I just assumed that was what I was looking for
"gdb vault.elf" just opens the debugger with vault.elf
and in the gdb session I just printed whatever was stored in secret_flag, which was the flag
